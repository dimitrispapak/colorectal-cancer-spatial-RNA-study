# Spatial transcriptomics analysis using GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler 
 - Dataset RNA samples originating from GeoMx DSP FFPE slides from liver metastatis of colorectal cancer.
 - Samples grouped into 3 categories based on treatment (Naive, Responder, Progressor).
 - 2 cell types are studies tumor cells probed with cytokeratine (CK) and leukocytes probed with CD45.
 - Differential expression done with generilized linear model from edgeR in R.
 - Final part, ontology enrichment and pathway analysis.
